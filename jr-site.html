With our accessible learning platform and our vibrant network of support, we equip our participants with the resources and environment they need to achieve lasting career success.</p>

		<h5><b>Wealth Generation</b></h5>
		<p>We set our  participants on a course to earn true career-level wages, which are crucial for accumulating the personal and family savings necessary to take on future opportunities and overcome inevitable setbacks.</p>
		<h5><b>Community</b></h5>
		<p>Community is not a given for many justice-involved individuals; thus, we actively cultivate a sense of belonging for all participants, along with an inclusive professional network that we hope offers lifelong career support.</p>

		<h5><b>Future-Focused Skills</b></h5>
		<p>Unlike existing learn-to-code platforms, which focus exclusively on technical skills, we also equip our participants with the "soft" skills and knowledge needed to thrive in a technology-related career.</p>

		<h5><b>Whole Person Support</b></h5>
		<p>To fix the broken journeys of our community, we must eliminate barriers like lack of access, mental health issues, and financial illiteracy. We confront these realities with intentional programming and partnerships focused on strengthening the whole person.</p>
